Redesign of Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools
===

# Overview
Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT) is a tool for authoring Intelligent Tutors. It is used extensively in research projects at CMU, as well as in the Personalized Online Learning course. With this tool, authors are able to build highly customized learning by doing exercises, and scale them with the mass-production function. It is able to provide step by step hints, as well as error specific feedback. Adaptivity is the sole objective.

However, these features come at a cost. To really achieve the promised adaptivity, a lot of effort is needed in the authoring process - the behavioral graph can be too complex to handle, and the hints and feedback requires a lot of manual input. This is a huge barrier for its broad adoption.

Above all, are Intelligent Tutors really valuable? What value do teachers see in them? Will it eventually change the game of classroom instruction?

Throughout this summer, a team of four METALS students, with the guidance of Prof. Vincent Aleven and Jonathan Sewall, explores the perspectives of different categories of CTAT users. With valuable data gathered from the interviews, they plan to make improvements to this powerful tool for broader adoption beyond research projects.
